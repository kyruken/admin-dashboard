# admin-dashboard

In this project, I replicated a static admin dashboard design using mainly CSS grid. I forcibly used CSS grid in certain parts where I personally thought CSS flexbox would have been better. I did this due to the instructions of the project to lean on CSS grid, and I thought it would be good practice anyway.

In this project, I learned about:
- Using CSS grid to layout a structure of a page
- Using grid-template-areas to create certain page layouts
- How to use icons, and how to link icon sheets
- How to use position relative due to having to rearrange icon placements

There are no features to this project because it's a static design.
